The aim of this project is to develop a complete system of collection, management and
a crowdsourced information analysis of spatiotemporal informationdata on human activity.
# Introduction
Google Maps service is used by millions of mobile phones users, to provide navigation services
and spatial information searching. In order to make this happen, you need to enable
location finding functions (via GPS, Wi-Fi or 3/4G network). With this service, Google
periodically stores the user's current location in the cloud so that the users can
see the history of their movements and suggest points of interest close to
to their locations.
Items that Google maintains for users are accessible only by themselves. 
Users can download data about themselves, by going to the website
https://takeout.google.com and by selecting the data associated with the Location History service. The
data can be downloaded in JSON or KMZ format (zipped KML).
